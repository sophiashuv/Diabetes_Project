Diabetes_Project is my course work from the course "The basics of programming".
My projects approach is to move counted on paper now norms of products and cures for people 
with diabetes into automatic process. Wiki contains reports from first two weeks of my work on 
this project. At current stage general information about goals, issues and methods I am going 
to use is available there.
